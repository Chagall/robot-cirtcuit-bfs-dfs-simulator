# Pre-established Robot Circuit BFS and DFS Simulators

On 01/2015 I attended the USP (Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo) course SCC0273 - Intelligent Mobile Robots

As part of the course I developed a project which simulated how a Lego EV3 robot would perform a breadth first search
and a depth first search on a pre-established circuit.

In the circuit the robot would have to perform the searches to find the goal "G", while also passing through the cities "A, B, C and D" and avoiding the obstacles "O".

The code was developed in standard C and it can be compiled with no problems using gcc.

I am releasing the code with the Code:Blocks project I used to develop it

That means all you have to do is download the project, compile it and run.
